        <p>  
        During major tournaments like the World Cup, UEFA Euros, and Copa America, 
        owners of Coppa Nouns have the chance to win ETH if they hold a Coppa Noun from a winning country. 
        If you mint or buy a Coppa Noun anytime during the tournament, you will automatically qualify for rewards for that country. 
        A snapshot will be taken at the kick-off of the final, so you will need to mint or buy your Coppa Noun before kick-off. 
        The winnings will be split among the holders of that country.


        </p>
        <p>
        For the Euros and Copa America, there will be a 0.5 ETH prize pool for both tournaments.
         For each tournament, rewards will be given out for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd place:          </p>
          <ul className="text-indent">
            1st place: 60% of the pool
          </ul>
          <ul className="text-indent">
            2nd place: 30% of the pool
          </ul>
          <ul className="text-indent">
            3rd place: 10% of the pool
          </ul>
        <p>
        The rewards will be paid out once the final has been played and a winning country has been decided. 
        Minting will continue throughout the tournament.

        Coppa Nouns would not exist without <ExternalLink href="https://www.footynouns.wtf/">Footy Nouns</ExternalLink>. 
        Footy Nouns originally launched in 2021 on Arbitrum. 
        The art was then released to the community and Coppa Nouns was born, finding a new home on Base. 
        While Coppa Nouns is not directly associated with Footy Nouns, we wouldn’t be here today if it weren’t for them.
